/*
This problem is about unit testing. Your company needs a function that meets the following requirements:

• For a given array of n integers, the function returns the index of the element with the minimum value in the array. If there is more than one element with the minimum value, it returns the smallest one.
• If an empty array is passed to the function, it raises an exception. A colleague has written this method. The implementation in Python is listed below. Implementations in other languages can be found in the code template.

A coworker has prepared functions that will perform the tests and validate return values. Finish the implementation of 3 classes to provide data and expected results for the tests. Complete the following methods.
